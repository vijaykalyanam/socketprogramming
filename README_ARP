1. struct sockaddr_ll : Link-Layer socket descriptor
	Packet sockets are used to receive or send raw packets at the device driver (OSI Layer 2) level.
	They allow the user to implement protocol modules in user space on top of the physical layer.

	sockaddr_ll has interface index where socket directly binds to interface depends on that.
	Remember, raw socket program do not bind to something like connection oriented things.

2. Ensure that while using sendto syscall, passing the right arguments.
sendto(sock, (const void *)req, sizeof(struct arp_packet), 0,
                                (struct sockaddr *)dev, sizeof(struct sockaddr_ll));

3. During the retrieval/interveince of RX data, it is already in network byte order.
